  https://github.com/spicygreenbook/greenbook-app/issues/220

* Review Slack #Developers - Create (private) notes 
  https://app.slack.com/client/T016AKB06MP/C01E91JCM0E

  Commented better README for New Developers to Team needed.
  New Issue opened (by other) and I volunteer to help (per Slack comments).
  https://github.com/spicygreenbook/greenbook-app/issues/278

* Create workspace @ local/desktop (for work on this issue)

* Make sure local/desktop environment ok
  ** latest node, npm
  ** npx browserslist@latest --update-db
  < if not updated , this will give false positive errors/warnings >

* Update package.json to use Next.v10 ; i.e. add
    "next": "^10.0.6",

* CLI per readme
  ** npm install
  < save in separate file output - in case you need to refer to it during deployment/remote build >

* Update config files
  ** next.config.js
  < Note 1: did not add external domain : imgix to domains below. > 
  < Note 2: to determine sizes, SGB needs to know what Media Queries are used by CSS Framework or 3rd Party >
  < (only) Added this 
	    // https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image
	    // https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization
	    images: {
	        //deviceSizes: [640, 750, 828, 1080, 1200, 1920, 2048, 3840],
	        //imageSizes: [16, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 256, 384],
	        domains: ['spicygreenbook.com'],
	    },

* Select test files
  ** It will be "faq" + "team" (they have images)

* Select test condition
  ** it is PageSpeed (what I sent on 1st issue comment). This will be same-same or apples-to-apples comparison.
  ** it is *not* same item used when issue opened (don't have URL software person used)
  ** it is *not* Lighthouse. Lighthouse @ Desktop/Developer Browser is NOT 100% the same conditions IRL (in real life)
  < note 3 : PageSpeed is "Deployed Files" (which is what users use from any location, any desktop, any browser). >
  < note 4 : Test scores are different for PageSpeed vs Lighthouse. The differences are unknown but they exists. >

* Update test files

  PRE REQ

  ** Other 1
  **** Logos should not be responsive image sourced from a 10000 x 4546 file (that's way way way too big). I left size as is.
  < The size aka 10000 x 4546 is not a typo. this may cause remote image optimization errors AFD (at a future date) >
  < Logos should be fixed/non_responsive images and small - max 400 x 100 >

  ** Other 2
  **** I could not find info on the Media Queries SGB uses to determine breakpoints.
  < Any optimization for images requires this info, even if it is 3rd party - all developers should know them. >
  < The info is needed to make sure responsive_CSS ** matches ** responsive_images. Usually this is pre defined via the CSS_framework or Vendor_config. >

  ** Misc 1  
  **** Manually updated image files in /public (using ImageOptim - on Mac @ 80% default config) 
  < BC (because) they were not optimized, locally. Any local image file should be optimized, locally. These were the png,jpg,svg files. >
  < Reminder A: @ SGB - there is no art direction/sign-off. >
  < Reminder B: @ SGB - image optimization is preferred to be performed by external/3rd party/vendor >

  ** Misc 2
  **** Font file references separated from CSS 
  < this is to appease PageSpeed/Lighthouse >
  < https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61909298/how-to-use-self-hosted-fonts-face-using-nextjs > 
  < IMHO system, websafe fonts should be used. >

  ** Misc 3
  **** Some of the dependencies can be moved to devDependencies.
  < Examples: npm, webpack, serve, etc.. I left package.json as is. >

  // ...

  REQUIRED = TEST locally / desktop (before deployment)

  expo start (in 1st shell window)
  npx next dev (in 2nd shell window)
  FAILED = webpack not installed locally (in package.json)
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43179531/error-cannot-find-module-webpack-lib-node-nodetemplateplugin
  FIX = rm package.json ; yarn add webpack

  REDO
  
  expo start (in 1st shell window)
  npx next dev (in 2nd shell window)
  Chrome Browser > Tab > https://localhost:3000
  < on 1st use of any page , page will compile. May take ~1-2 minutes. When done, will show up in browser tab. >

  NOTE 5 : Next.js officially recommends using "serve" to see/serve local builds
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63518597/how-to-run-next-js-application-build-out-directory

  NOTE 6 : Chrome extensions negatively affected this page's load performance. Try auditing the page in incognito mode or from a Chrome profile without extensions.

* Deploy

  < stop all ; check files to make sure nothing sensitive (keys, pwds) will be included >

  npx next build (in 2nd shell window)
  < will be ~2-5 minutes and may fail. If fails here, will fail on remote build. >

  NOTE 7 : Next.js differences btwn next build, next export, next start
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61724368/what-is-the-difference-between-next-export-and-next-build-in-next-js

  < login to vercel.com ; make sure you are under (build) quota and/or have space >
  < if needed, delete old builds, old projects, start 100% fresh (to avoid cache, artifacts, confusion, etc.) >
  < no need to CI via git > vercel ; you will deploy via CLI >

  vercel

  < follow default prompts . Upload may take ~ 2-5 minutes, build another ~ 2-5 minutes >
  < final output should look like this >
